    <h1>Welcome to Liberio Mukdani's Website!</h1>
    <p>
      I believe that software should mostly be <strong>free and open-source</strong>.
      By free, I mean that software should be free to run in any way a customer/user 
      <strong>chooses</strong>. A customer/user should also have the ability to freely
      <strong>check out the source code</strong> of the software, and be able to 
      freely <strong>modify and distribute</strong> the software as they please. To 
      find out more about open source software,
